	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>Perched among the trees on a rocky promontory overlooking the Coulonge river, this cottage was originally built in 1974 from 150 year old hand hewn timbers. It was renovated with great care in recent years to add modern amenities, while preserving the building's natural ambience. The cottage affords complete relaxation on a very private six acre property, and its abundant windows are unobstructed by curtains, offering wonderful views of the surrounding landscape, including the wide river as it bends around the point, and the lush mixed forest of the upper Gatineau hills in western Quebec, near Ottawa.</p>

	<p>Raw elegance, natural light, high ceilings, and large open spaces make for a feeling of being part of the surrounding nature rather than separate from it. There are two bedrooms, three double beds, a full tiled, three-piece bathroom and an additional cedar lined chamber containing a claw foot bathtub.  Furnishings and finish are simple but functional in keeping with the overall ambience of this 1350 square foot natural light filled building.  The kitchen is compacted, basic, and functions extremely well with a Jennair electric convection range, two under-counter fridges, an under-counter freezer and a microwave.  The open kitchen has all the necessary utensils, cutlery, dishes  etc. provided.  An outside BBQ and fresh tank of gas is also supplied for your convenience and holiday pleasure.</p>

		<h1>Recreation</h1>
		<p>Since 1978 our family cottage has served as a nature retreat, refuge, and sometimes home. It has been our playground and getaway. Our cottage provides an environment conducive to reading (from our extensive library), playing board games, relaxing, baking, swimming, listening to the river rapids, watching birds, going for walks, bike rides, or just sitting quietly, gazing through the many large windows while enjoying the ever changing day. Other activities may include sight seeing, exploring the bush roads, drifting down the river on inner tubes, canoeing, white water rafting, playing golf at the local course (only 2 km away), visiting the hamlets and villages of the upper Ottawa valley, or exploring the beautiful nearby Chutes waterfall area. If city attractions beckon, Ottawa, is only a 1 1/2 hours scenic drive along Highway 148. Pembroke Ontario is a very pleasant, short, thirty minute drive across the river. </p>

		<h1>Local Amenities</h1>
		<p>Almost everything is available locally in the town of Fort Coulonge, ten minutes driving from the cottage.   This includes a twenty four hour medical clinic staffed at all times by a doctor and nurses, pharmacy, liquor and grocery stores, building supplies, gas stations, restaurants, churches and virtually anything you would want or need to complete your relaxing holiday experience.</p>
